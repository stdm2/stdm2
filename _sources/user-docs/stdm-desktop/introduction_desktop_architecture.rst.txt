Description
=================================

The STDM 2.0 Desktop framework consists of the following APIs:

- App API
  This provides an interface that initializes and aggregates functionality in the ‘ui’ and ‘core’ classes depending on the target client i.e. desktop client as a standalone app or QGIS plugin.

- Core API
  The API contains non-ui classes that provide base services such as data management, security, workflows, spatial operations, document services etc. including Custom exceptions.

- UI API
  The API contains ui classes, including widgets, that expose functionality provided by core classes.
