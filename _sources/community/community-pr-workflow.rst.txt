Pull Request Workflow
=====================

Joining STDM 2.0 Open Source project, it's very likely that you won't get direct access to push commits or branches up to the repository itself. 
So, instead, you'll fork the repo, make the changes on your version of the repo, and then "pull request" your changes back to the original.

Here are the steps to take:

* First, visit its page on `STDM 2.0 GitHub <https://github.com/gltn/stdm2.git/>`_ and click the "Fork" icon in the upper 
  right of the page. This will create a fork of the project under your user account. 

* Next, clone your local version down to your local machine.
  ``git clone git@github.com:gltn/stdm2.git``

* In order to make it easy to keep your fork in sync with the original, add the original as a remote:
  ``git remote add upstream https://github.com/gltn/stdm2.git``.

* Create a local branch, but first make sure you are up-to-dat with the original repo

    - ``git checkout master``
    - ``git fetch upstream``
    - ``git merge upstream/master``
    - ``git push origin master``

    - Now you can spin up your new branch with the form ``fix/some-bug`` or ``feature/add-cool-thing`` and make your changes in that branch and commit them.:

    - ``git checkout -b my-feature-name``

* Make your changes, commit them, and push up to your forked repo for that branch.

* Now, you can create a pull request in the GitHub user interface. Visit your repo on GitHub and click the "New Pull Request" button, and you can create your PR from there.

* Make sure to explain the purpose, context, and anything else necessary for reviewers to understand the PR. See :ref:`submitting-patches`.
