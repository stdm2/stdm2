GUI Guidelines
========================

In order for all graphical user interface elements to appear consistent and to all the user to instinctively use dialogs,
it is important that the following guidelines are followed in layout and design of GUIs.

* Separate advanced options from basic ones:

* Keep harmful actions away from harmless ones. For example if you have actions for ‘delete’, ‘remove’ etc, try to impose adequate space.

* Don’t add options for the sake of having lots of options. Strive to keep the user interface minimalistic and use sensible defaults.

* Use consistent iconography.

* Capitalise first letter only in labels, tool tips, descriptive text, and other non-heading or title text.

* Capitalize all words in:

    - Titles (group box, tab, list view columns, and so on)
    - Functions (menu items, buttons), 
    - Selectable items (combobox items, listbox items, tree list items, and so on)
    - Capitalize allwords, except prepositions that are shorter than five letters (for example, ‘with’ but ‘Without’), conjunctions(for example, and, or, but), and articles (a, an, the).

* Try to avoid technical terms and rather use a laymans equivalent e.g.  use the word ‘Opacity’ rather than‘Alpha Channel’ (contrived example), ‘Text’ instead of ‘String’ and so on.

* Each window should be focused on a single task.

* Each window should be titled with a concise and explicit statement of its primary task. This can be a direct instruction or a question you want the user to answer.

* The title of the window should not be allowed to scroll off.

* Make the window's contents suit the task

* Provide a clear exit from the window
